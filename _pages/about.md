I am currently a Research Engineer at the Bush Combat Development Complex under the Texas A&M System, where I focus on perception and multi-object tracking for heterogeneous vehicle fleets to advance the Army's autonomy efforts. 
I hold an M.S. in Robotics from the University of Minnesota, which has equipped me with a strong foundation in robotics and computer vision. 

I'm excited to see the increasing role of robots in society and their interactions with humans. 
I hope to continue pushing the boundaries of autonomous systems and contribute to a future where robots and humans collaborate seamlessly to solve complex challenges!
